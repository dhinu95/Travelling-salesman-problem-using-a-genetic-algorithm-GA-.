# Travelling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm(GA)
#### Greedy algorithm is an algorithmic strategy that makes the best optimal choice at each small stage with the goal of this eventually leading to a globally optimum solution. This means that the algorithm picks the best solution at the moment without regard for consequences.
### Condition: Shortest possible route that visits each city once and return origin.
