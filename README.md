# Travelling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm(GA)
### Condition: Shortest possible route that visits each city once and return origin.
**Greedy algorithm:** Algorithmic strategy that makes the best optimal choice at each small stage with the goal of this eventually leading to a globally optimum solution. This means that the algorithm picks the best solution at the moment without regard for consequences.

City has been visited that city is not eligible to be travelled to again, the size of the search space stands as n! possible permutations.

**Fitness function** calculates the total distance between each city in the chromosomeâ€™s permutation.
**Selection:** Probability to create bias in choosing fitter chromosomes to serve as the parents.
